## Description 
This is an application for a software engineering team using the command line. The application will prompt the user for information nformation about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This assignment must also pass all unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.

I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles

The application will then render the team on an HTML page that will look like this:
